# MacroArc Studio

MacroArc Studio streamlines repetitive mouse and keyboard work without turning your desktop into another control panel. Record once, preview the sequence live, and replay it with a hotkey or a tuned auto clicker whenever the routine returns.

## Why MacroArc?

- **Trim the busywork** – Collapse long click/key routines into a single dependable playback.
- **Stay informed** – Dashboards surface live recorder events, queue state, and click totals so nothing fires blindly.
- **Blend with your setup** – Glass panels, motion cues, and subtle gradients keep the UI polished yet approachable.

## Feature Highlights

- **Macro Recorder** – Start/stop with `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M`, watch the event stack in real time, then name and save the capture the moment it feels right.
- **Macro Library & Queue** – Organize captures, map personal hotkeys via `HotkeyField`, and schedule back-to-back runs with automatic padding so sequences never collide.
- **Auto Clicker** – Pick button, interval, jitter, and optional burst limits, then toggle with `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+A`. Tick events stream into the metrics panel every burst.
- **Activity & Insights** – A running feed highlights successes, warnings, and queue changes, while the insight cards call out your most-used macros and click totals.
